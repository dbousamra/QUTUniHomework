/**
 * <p>
 * A ledger is a big book in which companies keep a record of their
 * commercial transactions, typically one page per day.
 * </p><p>
 * This interface defines the general characteristics of a
 * ledger that tracks three things: the current day; the current
 * stock level; and the current cash reserve.  It allows new
 * transactions to be recorded and the current or earlier day's
 * totals to be inspected.  For simplicity, days, stock levels and
 * cash reserves are all represented by type <code>Integer</code>.  Days are
 * assumed to be numbered from 1, rather than 0.
 * </p><p>
 * Your first two tasks in the assignment are to implement this
 * interface as class <code>WarehouseLedger</code>, and to produce a
 * <em>comprehensive</em> unit test suite for it.
 * </p><p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><strong>Constructor:</strong></dt>
 * <dd> To connect to the provided GUI, your
 * <code>WarehouseLedger</code> class must provide a constructor with
 * the following signature, as well as all the methods below.  The current day
 * defaults to 1 when a ledger is constructed.
 * </dd>
 * <dt><strong>Parameters:</strong></dt>
 * <dd><code>Integer initialStock</code> - initial stock level, in items<br>
 * <code>Integer initialCash</code> - initial cash reserve, in dollars<br>
 * <code>Integer wholesaleCostPerItem</code> - how much it costs to buy an item, in dollars<br>
 * <code>Integer retailPricePerItem</code> - how much we get from selling an item, in dollars<br>
 * <code>Integer deliveryCharge</code> - extra cost associated with buying items, in dollars</dd>
 * <dt><strong>Throws:</strong></dt>
 * <dd><code>WarehouseException</code> - if the stock level, wholesale cost, retail price or
 * delivery charge are negative, or if the wholesale cost is greater than
 * the retail price (but we may trade while insolvent, so no exception
 * is thrown for a negative initial cash reserve!)</dd>
