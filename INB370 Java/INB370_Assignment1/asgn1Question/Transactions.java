/**
 * <p>
 * This interface defines the daily transactions associated with managing
 * a buying-and-selling business, in this case a warehouse.
 * </p><p>
 * The assumed scenario is that each morning you may choose whether or not to
 * restock the warehouse, based on the current cash reserve and the number
 * of items in stock.  Later in the day an order for items will be received
 * which must be fulfilled.  At the end of each day the ledger is turned to the
 * next page.  Early the next morning your boss will check the ledger, to
 * ensure that you have not bankrupted the warehouse's cash reserve, or failed to
 * fulfill a client's order.  Either of these shortcomings will result in
 * immediate dismissal with no pay!
 * </p><p>
 * Your third and fourth tasks in the assignment are to implement this
 * interface as class <code>WarehouseTransactions</code> and produce a
 * <em>comprehensive</em> unit test suite for it.
 * </p><p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><strong>Constructor:</strong></dt>
 * <dd> To connect to the provided GUI, your
 * <code>WarehouseTransactions</code> class must provide a constructor with the following
 * signature, as well as all the methods below.</dd>
 * <dt><strong>Parameters:</strong></dt>
 * <dd><code>Integer warehouseCapacity</code> - the maximum capacity of the warehouse, in items<br>
 * <code>Integer jobDuration</code> - the duration of your fixed-term job as
 * warehouse manager, in days<br>
 * <code>WarehouseLedger ledger</code> - a ledger for recording the daily transactions performed
 * </dd>
 * <dt><strong>Throws:</strong></dt>
 * <dd><code>WarehouseException</code> if the warehouse capacity is negative or the job
 * duration is not strictly positive (greater than zero)</dd>
 * </dl>
