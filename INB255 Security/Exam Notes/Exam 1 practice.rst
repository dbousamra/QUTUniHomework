Question 1:

	a. 

		(i) 
			CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity, Accessibility. The security goal breached during a phishing attack are both the confidentiality and integrity of data.

		(ii)
			A vulnerability is a weakness found in a system that controls information or access. A threat on the other hand, is anything -either active or passive - that could exploit and compromise the security of a system. 

		(iii)

	b.

		The "Do" component of the PDCA refers to the implementation phase of the model. It involes implementing and operating of the Information Security Model System.

	c.) 

		(i) 
			The risk identification step is the first processes involved in section 5.4. During this phase risks need to be identified. All the possible threats and vulnerabilities need to be identified during this phase to allow proper analysis to take place. One needs to consider causes and scenarios, and use tools like checklists and judgements.

		(ii) 
			Information studies can be used during the risk analysis phase to give quantitative evidence and backing to a risk. If the study provided an estimate of how many people are "phished" we can deduce the Exposure factor. We may then be able to calculate the asset value and thus the annualised loss expectancy. This adds yet another layer of credibility to the evaluation of risks.

		(iii)
			Qualitative analysis is analysis that is described without concrete figures using "descriptive terms". Quantitative analysis on the other hand uses numerical evidence when talking about both the likelihood and the consequences. Quanlitative: Catastrophic, medium, moderate, emergency.
