Access control:

	Controlling how users and systems access other systems and resources

	Hardware, Software, Sssets (files, documentation), Services (computing, power)

	Unauthorized access could compromise C-I-A

Asset compromise is a BUSINESS LOSS

For effective access control you need to consider what resources you have. TAKE AN INVENTORY

Common Principles for Access control:

	Blacklists

	Whitelists

	Principle of least privilege:
		Access is restrived to the minimum resources required. I.e. People only get the minimum they need to do their job. Need to know basis.


Access control terminology:
	
	Subjects -> Entities requesting access to a resource (people, process, drive etc)

	Objects -> Resources of entities which contain information (disks, files, records etc)


If you have access to a resource:

	What can you do with it? READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, APPEND, SEARCH?


How will access control decisions be made?

	Three main approaches:

		Discretionary access control: Decision at discretion of some individual

		Mandatory access control: System wide set of rules applied

		Role-based access control: Decision based on the role of the individual rather then the identity (user, administrator, student etc)


Implementing access control:

	Phase 1 - Administration of privileges

		Which assets does the user have access to? Physical assets (building, rooms, telephone) or Electronic (files)

		What sort of access does the user have? Role?



User authentication:

	Can be categorised as:

		Knowledge based: Something you know

		Object based: Something you have

		Id Based: Something you are

		Location based: Somewhere you are

	Multifactor authentication uses combinations of the above categories


Knowledge based:

	Password, responses to questions etc

	Advantages: readily accepted, easily implemented

	Disadvantages: can be shared with others, easy to forget


Object based:

	Key, swipe card, token etc

	Advantages: Difficult to share. Effort required to make a copy. If lost the user will realise

	Disadvantages: Expensive.

ID Based:
	
	Fingerprint, eye scan, voice print, physical signature. Can't be lost or forgotten, Difficult to copy.

	Complex, not entirely secret.

Location based:

	Space and or time.

	Machine IP address and DNS name, link location to time. Must be on premises for instance

	Can improve network security

	Privacy issues.
