How do we manage risk?

	Establish the context
	-
	Identify risks
	-
	Analyse risks
	-
	Evaluate risks
	-
	Treat risks

Risks:

	"the effect of uncertainty on objectives"

	Consequence: The outcome of the event

	Likelihood: The chance of something happening

A risk is basically: 
	Likelihood = Threat + Vulnerability
	Consequence = What will happen

	Risk = Likelihood + Consequence

Communication and consultation:

	We need to consider these things at each step of the risk management process

	Develop communication and workflow plan for internal AND external stakeholders.


Establishing the context:
	
	External: Relationship between organisation and external environment it operates in

	Internal: Understand organisation and capabilities, goals and objectives

	Risk Management: Goals, objectives, strategies and scope that the process applies to

	Define the criteria the risk management process needs to think about (financial, technical, legal, social, operational etc)

Identify the risks:

	What can happen, and where, and how. Identify ALL plausible threats and existing vulnerabilities. 

	Consider causes and scenarios

	Identify risks using checklists, judgements audits etc

Analyse the risks:

	QUALITATIVE: Uses descriptive words. Eg: Consequence: Minor, Major, moderate, catastrophic etc

	QUANTITATIVE: Uses numerical values for both consequences and likelihoods


	AV: Asset Value (estimated total value of assets)

	EF: Exposure factor (% of asset lost caused by a threat occurrence)

	ARO: Annualized rate of occurrence (Frequence of occurrence in a year)


	SLE: Single Loss Expectancy (The cost of a single occurence) = AV * EF

	ALE: Annualised Loss Expectancy (The cost of a year) = SLE * ARO

Evaluate the Risks:

	Compare the level of risk found during ANALYSIS with the established risk criteria

	Decide which risks need treatement and prioritize them (High -> Immediate, Low -> Later on)

Treat Risks:

	Positive -> Actively change processes, change likelihood, change the consequences.

	Negative -> Avoid the risk, Reduce the likelhood of negative outcomes by either ruding likelhood of occurrence OR reducing the consequences

	Assess the risk treatement based on:

		Extent of risk reduction. It might not be worth it. Establish benefits vs cost

		High risks levels may be acceptable if beneficial opportunities arise as a result

		Balance the cost and effort

		Large risk reductions for low cost are great!


	Document the action plans. Responsibilities, proposed actions, timing, costs etc

Monitor and Review:

	Need to monitor the Risks, the effectiveness of the treatment plan etc


Information Security Management Standards:

	In AUSTRALIA: 27001: 2006 ---> Information Security Management Standards and Requirements
				  27002: 2006 ---> Code of practice for security management

	You can only get certification in AUSTRALIA for the 27001: 2006. The other one is optional

27001:

	PLAN: Establish the ISMS. I.e. establish the policy, standards, processes, procedures etc.

	DO: Implement those policies, promote the actions to manage risks.

	CHECK: Check it's all working and that things are acting effectively.

	ACT: Iterate and take action as a result of the check phase.
